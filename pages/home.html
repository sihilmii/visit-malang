  <p>Malang, the second largest city in East Java, is known for its cooler temperatures,
    beautiful surrounding countryside and attractive streets lined with historical buildings.
    Set on the Brantas River, Malang is a lively trade centre and a popular destination for visitors,
    with vibrant markets, parks and Dutch colonial buildings to see. The Dutch used it as a holiday escape,
    and a number of the mansions, government buildings and churches they built still remain standing today.</p>
